- **`WATCHFILES_README.md`** - Comprehensive usage documentation
- **`CRASHPROOFING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Implementation summary

### **Configuration & Deployment:**
- Updated `pyproject.toml` with watchfiles dependency
- Created `requirements-watchfiles.txt` for isolated installation
- **`install-watchfiles.ps1`** - PowerShell installation script
- **`run-with-watchfiles.ps1`** - Convenient runner with configuration options
- **`tapo-camera-mcp-watchfiles.service`** - Production systemd service file

## 🚀 **Key Features Implemented**

### **Camera-Specific Crash Detection**
- Monitors Tapo Camera MCP WebApp process health continuously
- Detects crashes from camera connectivity issues, network interruptions, USB disconnections
- Automatic restarts on hardware failures (camera offline, USB webcam disconnects)
- Specialized handling for surveillance application crash patterns

### **Smart Restart Logic**
- Exponential backoff: 1s → 1.5s → 2.25s → 3.375s... (optimized for camera reconnection times)
- Graceful process cleanup before restart with proper camera resource cleanup
- Cross-platform signal handling for camera device management
- Automatic camera reconnection attempts after restart

### **Health Monitoring**
- HTTP health checks via `/api/health` endpoint every 30 seconds
- Camera connectivity health verification
- Automatic restart on health check failures or camera offline status
- Detailed health status logging with camera-specific metrics

### **Comprehensive Logging**
- Structured logging to console and `logs/tapo-camera-mcp-watchfiles.log`
- Crash reports saved as JSON with camera connectivity details
- Process statistics tracking uptime, restart frequency, camera connection status
- Hardware-specific error categorization (network, USB, camera firmware)

### **Production Ready**
- Systemd service integration with security hardening
- Resource limits (2GB memory, 200% CPU) for surveillance workloads
- Proper signal handling for camera device cleanup
- Camera-specific environment variable configuration

- Long-running process memory accumulation mitigation

## 📈 **Benefits Achieved**

### **Before Crashproofing**
- ❌ Camera offline events cause complete service downtime
- ❌ Network interruptions break surveillance monitoring
- ❌ USB webcam disconnections require manual restart
- ❌ No visibility into camera connectivity failure patterns
- ❌ Development downtime during camera hardware debugging

### **After Crashproofing**
- ✅ Zero-touch recovery from camera connectivity issues
- ✅ Automatic USB webcam reconnection on hardware issues
- ✅ Network interruption transparent to surveillance operations
- ✅ Detailed crash analytics for camera hardware troubleshooting
- ✅ Production-grade stability for 24/7 security monitoring
