- **Camera Account ≠ Cloud Account**: 
  - Cloud Account = Tapo app access (your email/password)
  - Camera Account = API access (username/password you set in app)
  
- **Camera IP**: Kitchen camera should be at 192.168.0.164 after setup

- **After setup**: Camera will be accessible via API using Camera Account credentials
