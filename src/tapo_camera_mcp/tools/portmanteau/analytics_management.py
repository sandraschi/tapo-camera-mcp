        Comprehensive analytics management portmanteau tool for system monitoring and analysis.

        PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
        Consolidates analytics operations into a single interface to reduce tool explosion
        while maintaining full functionality. Supports performance analysis, system health
        monitoring, trend analysis, and comprehensive reporting.

        Args:
            action (Literal, required): The analytics operation to perform. Must be one of:
                - "performance_analysis": Full system performance analysis
                - "system_health": System health and resource monitoring
                - "camera_operations": Camera-specific performance analysis
                - "network_performance": Network latency and connectivity analysis
                - "trend_analysis": Trend analysis over time (requires: time_range)
                - "generate_report": Generate comprehensive analytics report

            time_range (str): Time range for trend analysis (default: "24h")
                - "1h", "24h", "7d", "30d", "90d"

            include_recommendations (bool): Include optimization recommendations (default: True)

            detailed (bool): Include detailed metrics and analysis (default: False)

            camera_id (str | None): Specific camera for camera_operations analysis

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any]: Dictionary containing:
                - success (bool): Boolean indicating if analysis succeeded
                - action (str): The action that was performed
                - data (dict): Analytics results (performance metrics, trends, recommendations, etc.)
                - error (str | None): Error message if success is False
