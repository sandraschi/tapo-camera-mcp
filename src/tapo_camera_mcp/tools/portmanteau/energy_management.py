        Comprehensive energy management portmanteau tool.

        PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
        Instead of creating 4+ separate tools (one per operation), this tool consolidates related
        energy operations into a single interface. Prevents tool explosion (4+ tools → 1 tool) while maintaining
        full functionality and improving discoverability. Follows FastMCP 2.12+ best practices.

        Args:
            action (Literal, required): The operation to perform. Must be one of: "status", "control",
                "consumption", "cost".
                - "status": Get smart plug status (optional: device_id for specific device)
                - "control": Control smart plug power (requires: device_id, power_state)
                - "consumption": Get energy consumption data (optional: device_id, time_range)
                - "cost": Get energy cost analysis (optional: device_id, time_range)

            device_id (str | None): Smart plug device ID. Required for: control operation.
                Optional for: status, consumption, cost operations (filters to specific device).

            power_state (str | None): Power state for control. Required for: control operation.
                Valid: "on", "off", "toggle"

            time_range (str): Time range for consumption/cost analysis. Used by: consumption, cost operations.
                Default: "24h". Valid: "1h", "24h", "7d", "30d"

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any]: Dictionary containing:
                - success (bool): Boolean indicating if operation succeeded
                - action (str): The action that was performed
                - data (dict): Operation-specific result data (status, consumption, cost, etc.)
                - error (str | None): Error message if success is False

        Examples:
            # Get status of all devices
            result = await energy_management(action="status")

            # Control specific device
            result = await energy_management(action="control", device_id="tapo_001", power_state="on")
