        Comprehensive weather management portmanteau tool.

        PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
        Instead of creating 6+ separate tools (one per operation), this tool consolidates related
        weather operations into a single interface. Prevents tool explosion (6+ tools → 1 tool) while maintaining
        full functionality and improving discoverability. Follows FastMCP 2.12+ best practices.

        Args:
            action (Literal, required): The operation to perform. Must be one of: "current", "historical",
                "stations", "alerts", "health", "analyze".
                - "current": Get current weather data (optional: station_id)
                - "historical": Get historical weather data (requires: start_date, end_date, optional: station_id)
                - "stations": List weather stations (no other parameters required)
                - "alerts": Configure weather alerts (optional: alert_config)
                - "health": Get weather station health (optional: station_id)
                - "analyze": Analyze weather patterns (requires: start_date, end_date, optional: station_id)
            
            station_id (str | None): Weather station ID. Used by: current, historical, health, analyze operations
                to filter to specific station.
            
            start_date (str | None): Start date for historical data. Required for: historical, analyze operations.
                Format: "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
            
            end_date (str | None): End date for historical data. Required for: historical, analyze operations.
                Format: "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
            
            alert_config (dict[str, Any] | None): Alert configuration. Used by: alerts operation.
                Required keys: "thresholds" (dict), "conditions" (list).
                Optional keys: "enabled" (bool), "notifications" (list)

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any]: Dictionary containing:
                - success (bool): Boolean indicating if operation succeeded
                - action (str): The action that was performed
                - data (dict): Operation-specific result data (weather data, stations, alerts, etc.)
                - error (str | None): Error message if success is False

        Examples:
            # Get current weather
