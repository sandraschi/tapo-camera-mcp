        Comprehensive AI analysis portmanteau tool for computer vision and scene understanding.

        PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
        Consolidates AI analysis operations into a single interface to reduce tool explosion
        while maintaining full functionality. Supports scene analysis, object detection,
        activity recognition, and contextual insights.

        Args:
            action (Literal, required): The analysis operation to perform. Must be one of:
                - "analyze_scene": Comprehensive scene analysis (objects + activities + context)
                - "detect_objects": Object detection only
                - "analyze_activity": Activity analysis only
                - "classify_scene": Scene classification (indoor/outdoor, day/night, etc.)

            camera_id (str, required): ID of the camera to analyze

            confidence_threshold (float): Minimum confidence threshold (0.0-1.0, default: 0.7)

            include_details (bool): Include detailed analysis results (default: True)

            analysis_type (str): Type of analysis for analyze_scene action (default: "comprehensive")
                - "comprehensive": Full analysis with recommendations
                - "quick": Fast analysis without recommendations
                - "detailed": Detailed analysis with all metadata

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any]: Dictionary containing:
                - success (bool): Boolean indicating if analysis succeeded
                - action (str): The action that was performed
                - data (dict): Analysis results (scene_type, objects, activities, recommendations, etc.)
                - error (str | None): Error message if success is False

        Examples:
            # Comprehensive scene analysis
