FastMCP 2.14.1+ Sampling with Tools Orchestration Tools (SEP-1577)

These tools demonstrate SEP-1577: Sampling with tools, enabling agentic workflows
where servers borrow the client's LLM and autonomously control tool execution.

Benefits:
- Eliminates client round-trips for complex multi-step operations
- LLM autonomously orchestrates tool usage decisions
- Server controls execution flow and logic
- Massive efficiency gains for security automation

SECURITY AUTOMATION WORKFLOWS:
- "Secure the house" → autonomous camera positioning, lighting activation, alarm arming
- "Monitor facility overnight" → autonomous surveillance coordination, motion detection responses
- "Emergency response" → coordinated camera PTZ, lighting alerts, security notifications

    Execute agentic security workflows using FastMCP 2.14.1+ sampling with tools.

    This tool demonstrates SEP-1577 by enabling the server's LLM to autonomously
    orchestrate complex security operations without client round-trips.

    MASSIVE EFFICIENCY GAINS:
    - LLM autonomously decides tool usage and sequencing
    - No client mediation for multi-step security operations
    - Structured validation and error recovery
    - Parallel processing capabilities

    SECURITY WORKFLOW EXAMPLES:
    - "Secure the house" → camera positioning, lighting, alarms
    - "Monitor facility overnight" → surveillance coordination, alerts
    - "Emergency response" → PTZ cameras, lighting alerts, notifications

    Args:
        workflow_prompt: Description of the security workflow to execute
        available_tools: List of security tool names to make available to the LLM
        max_iterations: Maximum LLM-tool interaction loops (default: 5)

    Returns:
        Structured response with workflow execution results

    Example:
        # Secure the house workflow
        result = await agentic_security_workflow(
            workflow_prompt="Secure the house for the night",
