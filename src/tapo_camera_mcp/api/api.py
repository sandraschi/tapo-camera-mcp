            Retrieves a comprehensive list of all cameras registered in the system,
            including their connection status, configuration details, and availability.

            Returns:
                Dictionary containing:
                    - status: "success" or "error"

                    - message: Error message string (only present on error)

            Usage:
                Use this tool to get an overview of all configured cameras before
                performing operations. This is typically the first tool called to
                understand what cameras are available in the system.

                Common scenarios:
                - Initial setup verification
                - Camera management dashboard
                - Troubleshooting connection issues
                - Inventory and status monitoring

            Examples:
                Basic usage:
                    result = await list_cameras()

                    # }

                Error handling:
                    result = await list_cameras()

            Raises:
                Exception: Propagated from camera manager operations (network issues, authentication failures)

            Notes:
                - Cameras are listed regardless of connection status
                - Status is determined by last known connection state
                - Network connectivity is tested during status checks

                - Adding replacement cameras
                - Expanding camera coverage

                Use this tool to capture still images for monitoring, verification, or
                archival purposes. Ideal for checking camera positioning, lighting conditions,
                or documenting specific moments/events.

                Common scenarios:
                - Camera setup and positioning verification
                - Security monitoring and incident documentation
                - Automated snapshot scheduling
                - Quality assurance and testing
                - Scene documentation before/after changes

            Examples:
                Capture and return image data:
                    result = await capture_still('front_door')
                    if result['status'] == 'success':
                        image = result['image']  # PIL Image object
                        print(f"Captured image from {result['camera']}")
                    # Returns: {'status': 'success', 'camera': 'front_door', 'image': <PIL.Image>}

                Capture and save to file:
                    result = await capture_still('living_room', '/photos/security/snapshot.jpg')
                    if result['status'] == 'success':
                        print(f"Image saved to {result['image']}")
                    # Returns: {
                    #     'status': 'success',
                    #     'camera': 'living_room',
                    #     'image': '/photos/security/snapshot.jpg'
                    # }

                Error handling - camera not found:
                    result = await capture_still('nonexistent')
                    if result['status'] == 'error':
                        print(f"Capture failed: {result['message']}")
                    # Returns: {'status': 'error', 'camera': 'nonexistent', 'message': 'Camera not found: nonexistent'}

                Error handling - empty camera parameter:
                    result = await capture_still('')
                    # Returns: {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Camera name is required'}

                Error handling - camera connection issues:
                    result = await capture_still('disconnected_cam')
                    # Returns: {
                    #     'status': 'error',
                    #     'camera': 'disconnected_cam',
                    #     'message': 'Connection failed: camera offline'
                    # }

            Raises:
                Exception: Propagated from camera operations (connection failures, hardware issues, file system errors)

            Notes:
                - Camera must be connected and operational
                - Image capture may take several seconds depending on camera type
                - Large images may consume significant memory when not saving to file
                - File paths are resolved relative to the working directory
                - Existing files at save_path will be overwritten
                - Image format is determined by file extension or defaults to JPEG

            Retrieves the appropriate streaming endpoint URL for the specified camera,
            allowing access to live video feeds. The URL format depends on the camera
            type and configured streaming protocol (RTSP, RTMP, HLS, etc.).

            Parameters:
                camera: Camera name/identifier to get stream URL for (required)
                    - Must match an existing camera name exactly

            Usage:
                Use this tool to obtain streaming URLs for video playback, monitoring,
                or integration with external systems. Essential for setting up video
                feeds in dashboards, monitoring applications, or automated systems.

                Common scenarios:
                - Setting up video monitoring dashboards
                - Integrating with video management systems
                - Automated recording and analysis pipelines
                - Live streaming to web interfaces
                - Third-party application integration

            Examples:

            Raises:

            Notes:
                - Camera must be connected and operational
                - Stream URLs may include authentication credentials
                - URL format varies by camera type and protocol
                - Some cameras require active connection to generate URLs
                - URLs may have expiration times or session limitations
                - Network connectivity is required for streaming
                - Firewall rules may need to allow streaming ports
