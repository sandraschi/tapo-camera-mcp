            Retrieves a comprehensive list of all cameras registered in the system,
            including their connection status, configuration details, and availability.

            Usage:
                Use this tool to get an overview of all configured cameras before
                performing operations. This is typically the first tool called to
                understand what cameras are available in the system.

                Common scenarios:
                - Initial setup verification
                - Camera management dashboard
                - Troubleshooting connection issues
                - Inventory and status monitoring

            Examples:
                Basic usage:
                    result = await list_cameras()

                Error handling:

            Raises:
                Exception: Propagated from camera manager operations (network issues, authentication failures)

            Notes:
                - Cameras are listed regardless of connection status
                - Status is determined by last known connection state
                - Network connectivity is tested during status checks

                    - image: Image data or file path (only present on success)
                        - PIL Image object if save_path not provided
                        - File path string if save_path was provided
                    - message: Error description (only present on error)

            Usage:
                Use this tool to capture still images for monitoring, verification, or
                archival purposes. Ideal for checking camera positioning, lighting conditions,
                or documenting specific moments/events.

                Common scenarios:
                - Camera setup and positioning verification
                - Security monitoring and incident documentation
                - Automated snapshot scheduling
                - Quality assurance and testing
                - Scene documentation before/after changes

            Examples:
                Capture and return image data:
                    result = await capture_still('front_door')
                    if result['status'] == 'success':
                        image = result['image']  # PIL Image object
                        print(f"Captured image from {result['camera']}")
                    # Returns: {'status': 'success', 'camera': 'front_door', 'image': <PIL.Image>}

                Capture and save to file:
                    result = await capture_still('living_room', '/photos/security/snapshot.jpg')
                    if result['status'] == 'success':
                        print(f"Image saved to {result['image']}")
                    # Returns: {
                    #     'status': 'success',
                    #     'camera': 'living_room',
                    #     'image': '/photos/security/snapshot.jpg'
                    # }

                Error handling - camera not found:
                    result = await capture_still('nonexistent')
                    if result['status'] == 'error':
                        print(f"Capture failed: {result['message']}")
                    # Returns: {'status': 'error', 'camera': 'nonexistent', 'message': 'Camera not found: nonexistent'}

                Error handling - empty camera parameter:
                    result = await capture_still('')
                    # Returns: {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Camera name is required'}

                Error handling - camera connection issues:
                    result = await capture_still('disconnected_cam')
                    # Returns: {
                    #     'status': 'error',
                    #     'camera': 'disconnected_cam',
                    #     'message': 'Connection failed: camera offline'
                    # }

            Raises:
                Exception: Propagated from camera operations (connection failures, hardware issues, file system errors)

            Notes:
                - Camera must be connected and operational
                - Image capture may take several seconds depending on camera type
                - Large images may consume significant memory when not saving to file
                - File paths are resolved relative to the working directory
                - Existing files at save_path will be overwritten
                - Image format is determined by file extension or defaults to JPEG

            Retrieves the appropriate streaming endpoint URL for the specified camera,
            allowing access to live video feeds. The URL format depends on the camera
            type and configured streaming protocol (RTSP, RTMP, HLS, etc.).

            Parameters:

                - Live streaming to web interfaces
                - Third-party application integration

            Notes:
                - Camera must be connected and operational
                - Stream URLs may include authentication credentials
                - URL format varies by camera type and protocol
                - Some cameras require active connection to generate URLs
                - URLs may have expiration times or session limitations
                - Network connectivity is required for streaming
                - Firewall rules may need to allow streaming ports
