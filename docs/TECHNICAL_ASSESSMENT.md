- **Advanced Security Features**: Motion detection, alerts, analysis

## Functionality Matrix

| Feature Category | Tool Count | Confidence Level | Notes |
|------------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| Core Camera Ops | 8 | High | USB webcam, basic capture, listing |
| Network Integration | 6 | Medium | Tapo connection, streaming, controls |
| PTZ Management | 7 | Medium | Hardware dependent, needs testing |
| Security Features | 4 | Medium-Low | Motion detection, analysis, scanning |

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Validation (2-3 days)
```bash
# Core functionality testing
- USB webcam detection and capture
- Basic camera listing and info
- Web dashboard startup and UI
- Image save/retrieve operations
```

### Phase 2: Network Integration (3-4 days)  
```bash
# IP camera connectivity
- Tapo camera connection and authentication
- RTSP stream access and quality
- Basic control commands (LED, privacy, reboot)
- Dashboard live streaming integration
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 days)
```bash
# Extended functionality
- PTZ movement and preset management
- Motion detection configuration
- Multi-camera simultaneous operation
- Error recovery and reconnection handling
```

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (2-3 days)
```bash
# Third-party services
- Ring doorbell integration (if hardware available)
- Furbo pet camera integration (if hardware available)  
- Performance under concurrent load
- Dashboard UI/UX validation
```

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk Areas
- **Ring API Changes**: Vendor may modify authentication or rate limits
- **Furbo API Stability**: Limited documentation, niche market support
- **Network Discovery**: Complex router/firewall configurations
- **Concurrent Streaming**: Bandwidth and CPU resource constraints

### üü° Medium Risk Areas
- **Tapo Authentication**: Known to be finicky but well-documented solutions exist
- **PTZ Hardware Compatibility**: Requires specific camera models with PTZ support
- **Dashboard WebRTC**: Browser compatibility and streaming stability
- **Multi-Camera Resource Management**: Memory and processing overhead

### üü¢ Low Risk Areas
- **USB Webcam Operations**: Mature OpenCV integration
- **Basic File Operations**: Standard filesystem interactions
- **RTSP Protocol Handling**: Well-established streaming standard
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based settings and presets

## Hardware Requirements

### Supported Camera Types
- **USB Webcams**: Any OpenCV-compatible device (most standard webcams)
- **Tapo IP Cameras**: Models with API access (C200, C210, C310, etc.)
- **Ring Doorbells**: Video Doorbell series (authentication required)
- **Furbo Pet Cameras**: Furbo Dog Camera models

### Network Requirements
- **Local Network Access**: IP cameras must be on accessible network segment
- **Port Configuration**: Default RTSP ports (554) and camera-specific ports
- **Bandwidth Considerations**: Multiple HD streams require adequate bandwidth

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] **Core USB webcam functionality validated**
- [ ] **Tapo IP camera connection stability tested**
- [ ] **Web dashboard UI/UX completed and polished**
