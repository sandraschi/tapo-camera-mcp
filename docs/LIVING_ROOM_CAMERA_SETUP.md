# Living Room Camera Setup

## Steps to Set Up Living Room Camera

1. **Open Tapo App** → Living Room Camera
2. **Settings** (gear icon) → **Advanced Settings**
3. **Camera Account** (or Local Device Settings)
4. **Create or view** Camera Account credentials:
   - Username: (set your choice - often `admin`)
   - Password: (set your choice - write it down!)
5. **Enable Third-Party Compatibility** (if not already enabled globally):
   - Me → Tapo Lab → Third-Party Compatibility → ON
   - Or check camera-specific settings

## Once You Have Credentials

Provide:
- Username: _______________
- Password: _______________
- Device Name: _______________ (optional - shows in app)

Then I'll update `config.yaml` with the credentials.

## Note

**Don't test yet** - kitchen camera is locked out. We'll test the living room camera after:
1. Kitchen camera authentication is resolved, OR
2. We've identified if it's a general issue or camera-specific

Testing both cameras carefully will help us understand if the authentication issue is:
- **Camera-specific** (kitchen camera only) → Camera has a problem
- **General issue** (both cameras) → Our authentication method has a problem
