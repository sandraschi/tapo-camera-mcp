**Timestamp**: 2025-01-17  
**Status**: PLANNING - Research Complete  
**Tags**: health-monitoring, cgm, blood-pressure, medical-devices, integration, hipaa

## Overview

This ADN documents the research, planning, and implementation strategy for integrating human health monitoring capabilities into the Home Security MCP system. The focus is on blood pressure and blood glucose monitoring from connected medical sensors, with special attention to the latest 2025 full-year implantable sensor technology.

## 2025 Breakthrough: Full-Year Implantable CGM

### Eversense 365 - 365-Day Sensor (2025 Launch)

**Major Update**: In September 2024, the FDA approved **Eversense 365**, which launched in 2025. This is a revolutionary advancement in continuous glucose monitoring:

- **Sensor Duration**: **365 days (full year)** - Previously only 90 days
- **Calibration**: Weekly calibration required (vs daily for other systems)
- **FDA Approval**: September 2024
- **US Launch**: 2025
- **Manufacturer**: Senseonics Holdings Inc.

**Key Features**:
- Small sensor implanted under the skin of upper arm
- Removable smart transmitter worn over the sensor
- Mobile app provides real-time glucose readings
- Longest sensor life available (365 days vs 90 days for Eversense E3, 10-14 days for Dexcom/Libre)

**Insurance Coverage**:
- Expanding coverage (Cigna and others)
- Medicare coverage varies
- Typically covered for type 1 or type 2 diabetes with insulin therapy

**Integration Implications**:
- Longest data continuity (no sensor replacement for a full year)
- Reduced user intervention (weekly vs daily calibration)
- More stable data collection for trend analysis
- Lower long-term cost despite higher upfront cost

## Database Schema (Planned)

```sql
-- Health metrics table
CREATE TABLE health_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255),
    metric_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'blood_pressure', 'glucose', 'heart_rate'
    value NUMERIC,
    unit VARCHAR(20), -- 'mmHg', 'mg/dL', 'bpm'
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    device_id VARCHAR(255),
    device_type VARCHAR(100), -- 'eversense_365', 'dexcom_g7', 'qardio_arm'
    metadata JSONB -- Additional data (systolic/diastolic, trends)
);

-- Health alerts table
CREATE TABLE health_alerts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255),
    metric_type VARCHAR(50),
    alert_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'high', 'low', 'critical'
    value NUMERIC,
    threshold NUMERIC,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    acknowledged BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

## Configuration Structure (Planned)

```yaml
health:
  enabled: true
  integrations:
    nightscout:
      enabled: false
      url: ""  # User's Nightscout URL
      api_secret: ""  # API secret
    apple_healthkit:
      enabled: false
    google_fit:
      enabled: false
      client_id: ""
      client_secret: ""
  alerts:
    glucose:
      high_threshold: 180  # mg/dL
      low_threshold: 70
      critical_high: 250
      critical_low: 50
    blood_pressure:
      high_systolic: 140   # mmHg
      high_diastolic: 90
      low_systolic: 90
      low_diastolic: 60
```

## Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Requirements
- ✅ Encryption at rest and in transit
- ✅ Access controls and authentication
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Data minimization
- ✅ User consent mechanisms
- ✅ Data deletion rights

### Privacy Considerations
- Health data stored separately from other system data
- No sharing without explicit consent
- GDPR, CCPA compliance
- Regular security audits

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Nightscout First**: Start with Nightscout for CGM integration (open-source, well-established)
2. **Health Aggregators for BP**: Use HealthKit/Fit for blood pressure (easier than direct APIs)
3. **PostgreSQL**: Use existing PostgreSQL database for health metrics
4. **Real-time Updates**: Poll Nightscout every 5 minutes (or use webhooks if available)
5. **Alert System**: Critical alerts trigger immediately, warnings can be batched

## Cost Analysis

### Development Costs
- Developer time: ~10-12 weeks estimated
- Testing devices: ~$500-1000 (various devices)

### Operational Costs
- Database storage: Minimal (health data is small)
- API costs: Free for Nightscout, Google Fit free tier sufficient
- Infrastructure: No additional costs (uses existing)

### User Costs
- **Eversense 365**: Insurance-covered for eligible users; higher upfront cost but lower long-term (1 year vs multiple replacements)
- **Dexcom/Libre**: Insurance-covered for insulin users; ~$300-400/month without insurance
- **Blood Pressure Monitors**: One-time purchase $60-150
- **Nightscout Hosting**: Free (self-hosted) or ~$5-10/month (cloud)

## Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation (database, config) - **PENDING**
- **Weeks 3-4**: Nightscout integration - **PENDING**
- **Weeks 5-6**: Health aggregator integration - **PENDING**
- **Weeks 7-8**: Web UI - **PENDING**
- **Week 9**: Alerts & notifications - **PENDING**
- **Week 10+**: Advanced features - **FUTURE**

**Total Estimated Time**: 10-12 weeks for full implementation

## Success Metrics

1. **Data Accuracy**: 99%+ accuracy in data collection
2. **Uptime**: 99.9% availability for health data
3. **Alert Response**: <1 minute latency for critical alerts
4. **User Adoption**: Track number of users enabling health monitoring
5. **Data Completeness**: >95% of expected readings captured

## Risk Mitigation

1. **API Changes**: Monitor for API deprecations, have fallback options
2. **Device Compatibility**: Support multiple devices to avoid vendor lock-in
3. **Data Loss**: Regular backups, redundant data sources
4. **Privacy Breaches**: Regular security audits, encryption, access controls
5. **Regulatory Changes**: Stay updated on HIPAA and other regulations
