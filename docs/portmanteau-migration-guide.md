# Portmanteau Tools Migration Guide

## From Brand-Based to Functionality-Based Organization

### **Current Problem:**
```
User wants to control lights:
- Do they use lighting_management? (Hue only)
- Or tapo_control? (includes Hue + Tapo lights)
- Confusion and overlap!
```

### **Solution:**
```
User wants to control lights:
- Use lighting_management (ALL lights, any brand)
- Simple, intuitive, no confusion!
```

---

## Migration Steps

## Phase 1: Lighting Consolidation ✅

### **Current State:**
- `lighting_management`: Hue lights only
- `tapo_control`: Hue lights + Tapo lights (DUPLICATE!)

### **Migration:**
```bash
# Move all Hue functions from tapo_control to lighting_management
# Update lighting_management to support both Hue and Tapo
# Remove Hue functions from tapo_control
```

### **After Migration:**
```python
# lighting_management supports:
LIGHTING_BRANDS = ["hue", "tapo", "future_brands"]

# tapo_control becomes Tapo-only:
TAPO_ONLY = ["cameras", "plugs", "kitchen_devices"]
```

## Phase 2: Kitchen Consolidation

### **Current State:**
- `kitchen_management`: Kitchen appliances
- `tapo_control`: Kitchen appliances (DUPLICATE!)

### **Migration:**
```bash
# Move kitchen functions from tapo_control to kitchen_management
# kitchen_management becomes the single source for all kitchen control
```

## Phase 3: Camera Unification

### **Current State:**
- `camera_management`: Some cameras
- `ring_management`: Ring cameras
- `tapo_control`: Tapo cameras

### **Migration:**
```bash
# Merge all camera functions into camera_management
# Support multiple brands: Tapo, Ring, IP cameras, webcams
```

## Phase 4: Energy Devices

### **Current State:**
- `energy_management`: Energy monitoring
- `tapo_control`: Tapo plugs

### **Migration:**
```bash
# Move plug control from tapo_control to energy_management
# energy_management handles all energy devices
```

## Tool Mapping (Before → After)

### **Lighting Control:**
```
BEFORE:
- lighting_management: Hue lights
- tapo_control: Hue + Tapo lights

AFTER:
- lighting_management: ALL lights (Hue + Tapo + future)
- tapo_control: No lighting functions
```

### **Camera Control:**
```
BEFORE:
- camera_management: Limited cameras
- ring_management: Ring cameras
- tapo_control: Tapo cameras

AFTER:
- camera_management: ALL cameras (Tapo + Ring + IP + webcams)
- ring_management: DEPRECATED (merged into camera_management)
```

### **Energy Control:**
```
BEFORE:
- energy_management: Energy monitoring
- tapo_control: Smart plugs

AFTER:
- energy_management: ALL energy devices (plugs + monitors + sensors)
- tapo_control: No plug functions
```

### **Kitchen Control:**
```
BEFORE:
- kitchen_management: Kitchen appliances
- tapo_control: Kitchen appliances

AFTER:
- kitchen_management: ALL kitchen appliances
- tapo_control: No kitchen functions
```

## Backward Compatibility

### **During Migration:**
- Keep old tools functional but mark as deprecated
- Provide clear migration path in error messages
- Support both old and new APIs

### **Migration Helpers:**
```python
# Old way (still works during migration)
tapo_control("turn_on_light", light_id="hue_lamp_1")

# New way (recommended)
lighting_management("turn_on_light", light_id="hue_lamp_1")
```

### **Deprecation Timeline:**
- **Phase 1:** Mark tapo_control lighting functions deprecated
- **Phase 2:** Mark separate kitchen/camera tools deprecated
- **Phase 3:** Remove deprecated functions (6 months later)
